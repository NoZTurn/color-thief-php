# Color Thief PHP Changelog

## `2.0.1`

**Bug fix**
- Fixes a regression in 2.0.0 that could cause an infinite loop under specific circumstances (see #52).

## `2.0.0`

**New features**
- PHP 8 compatibility (see #48 and #50, thank @Agapanthus).
- Add support for reading WebP images (see #45, thank @mreiden).
- Add support for multiple output color formats (RGB, hexadecimal, integer, array or instances of `ColorThief\Color` class).
- Add support for image adapter selection. You can now choose which image extension to use between GD, Imagick or Gmagick, or provide a custom image adapter.

**Bug fix**
- Fix bug where `getPalette()` does not always return the requested amount of colors (see #5).

**Breaking changes**
- Drop support for PHP 5.x, 7.0 and 7.1, now require 7.2+.
- Reworked exceptions so that all exceptions now inherit from `ColorThief\Exception\Exception`. 
  Migrating from 1.x may require tweaking exception handling in calling code to avoid unhandled exceptions or preserve error handling logic. See 1bf90f40 for details.

**Noticeable changes**
- Switch to MIT license.
- Fileinfo extension is now required.
- Rework some internal image loading logic.
